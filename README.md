# 🐔 Broiler Disease Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning–based broiler disease classification system using image data. The model is trained to distinguish between healthy and diseased broilers to support early detection and improve poultry health monitoring.

## 📘 Project Overview
Broiler diseases can significantly affect poultry production, food quality, and economic sustainability. Traditional diagnosis methods are labor-intensive and require expert supervision. This project applies machine learning and computer vision techniques to automate disease detection from images.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Classify broiler images into disease categories
- Assist farmers and veterinarians with early diagnosis
- Demonstrate the role of AI in smart agriculture

## 🧠 Model & Methods
The project was developed and trained using **Jupyter Notebook**.  
Techniques used include:

- Image preprocessing & augmentation  
- Feature extraction using deep learning  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Performance visualization (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix)

> *(You can add your specific model name — e.g., CNN, ResNet, MobileNet, etc.)*
